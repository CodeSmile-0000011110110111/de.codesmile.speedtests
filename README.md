# CodeSmile SpeedTests

I dump general performance measurement tests in here whenever I need to assess the performance of certain alternative ways of achieving the same thing.

The measurements are done with [Performane Testing package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.test-framework.performance@3.0/manual/).
